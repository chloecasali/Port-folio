                    Hi ! My name's <span class="first-name">Chloe</span> and i'm 19 years old.
                    I'm currently a student at OpenClassrooms since August 2022 and I've just finished my four mouths of Prep'apprentissage, 
                    a course divided into three parts with the search of the chosen profession that suits me, 
                    a project to be carried out with the help of a mentor of the chosen profession, and finally the search for a work-study program (apprenticeship).
                    So, I want to join a company to continue, in a work-study program, my course of web development at OpenClassrooms for a year.
                    In the future, I will also follow a course in UI/UX Design because I'm very interested by that and I would like to learn more of that and in particular, to qualify myself 
                    as a full stack web developer and UI/UX designer. <br> <br>

                    I started be interested of web development when I was very young, thanks to my brother who had created a forum on the internet.
                    This forum had really caught my interest when I use it, but I hadn't realize it at the time.
                    Growing up, I found it easy to manipulate this environment by helping my family, my class mates and people around me. Then, I decide to create 
                    my website, a website about animals.
                    
                    I left this interest for the web a little bit to find out what my future would be like, not knowing that the web professions were, in fact, emerging more and more.
                    It was in 12th grade that I completely changed paths, moving from journalism to web development, which suited me better.

                    So I did everything to start this retraining as soon as possible, and here I am, creating my port-folio from A to Z and
                    looking for a work-study program in web development.
